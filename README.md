# Coin-Counter
## Python Programming Final Project

This project I was assigned to create a graphic user interface that would operate similar to a coinstar machine. The project takes the number of physical coins in the user's possession and tells the user the total value. This was the first project that I created making a GUI.

## Additional libraries used

1. tkinter
